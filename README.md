# Gambit Report for Destiny 2
This simple site shows Gambit data and statistics for a given player in an easy-to-read format.

[Site can be accessed here](https://leemotheyer.github.io/gambit-report/)

## Features:
- Recent games: View your most recent Gambit matches and keep track of wins and losses.
- Reputation statistics: Keep track of your Gambit reputation level, progress towards the next level, and how far from a reset.
- Average stats: Keep track of recent performance including kills, deaths, and win percentage.

### This is still a work in progress
Please note that this is still a work in progress. Currently, I would say this project is usable but not complete. If you have any suggestions for additions or changes, feel free to let me know or fork the project.
